{"name":"Nereid-demo-store","body":"# Welcome to Nereid.\r\n\r\nNereid is a web framework built over Flask, with Tryton as a Backend. To know more about Nereid, you could read the [documentation](http://nereid.openlabs.co.in/docs/).\r\n\r\n## The demo store\r\nThe demo store is an fictional e-commerce store, hosted at [nereid-demo.openlabs.co.in](http://nereid-demo.openlabs.co.in). The store is powered by [nereid](http://nereid.openlabs.co.in/docs/) and the following tryton modules which provides the e-commerce functionality. The data in the store is a subset of the [ICECAT Open Catalogue](http://www.icecat.biz/) and the images are loaded from Icecat too (which is terribly slow at times). Before you ask, the price in the store is a random value between 0 and 1000 and has no relation whatsoever to real prices (That is not a problem since we dont ship what you buy).\r\n\r\n  * Server: nereid-demo.openlabs.co.in\r\n  * Trytond: runs on same server on port 8000\r\n  * Store URL: http://nereid-demo.openlabs.co.in\r\n  * Database name: nereid\r\n  * Login Credentials: admin/admin\r\n\r\nThe demo is hosted on an [Amazon (AWS) Micro instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) with 613 MB of memory and runs trytond, postgres 9.0 and nereid over nginx.\r\n\r\n### Nereid Catalog\r\nAllows displaying of products and depends on the tryton product module. It also introduces a concept of Browse Nodes which allows you to attach products to multiple hierarchical classifications.\r\n\r\nSource Code: [Nereid Catalog on Github](https://github.com/openlabs/nereid-catalog)\r\n\r\n### Nereid Cart (B2C)\r\nContributes to the shopping cart experience.\r\n\r\nSource Code: [Nereid Cart (B2C) on Github](https://github.com/openlabs/nereid-cart-b2c)\r\n\r\n### Nereid Checkout\r\nModule implements the checkout functionality and includes a standard one page checkout functionality.\r\n\r\nSource Code: [Nereid Checkout on Github](https://github.com/openlabs/nereid-checkout)\r\n\r\n### Nereid Payment\r\nThis module builds the basic architecture on which all other payment gateways could be based. By default this offers COD (Cash on Delivery) and Cheque payments as options.\r\n\r\nSource Code: [Nereid Payment on Github](https://github.com/openlabs/nereid-payment)\r\n\r\n### Nereid Facebook Authentication\r\nProvides facebook based authentication in addition to the conventional login.\r\n\r\nSource Code: [Nereid Facebook Auth on Github](https://github.com/openlabs/nereid-auth-facebook)\r\n\r\n### Demo store module and templates\r\nHas the template for the store and some quick hacks we used to build this site.\r\n\r\nSource Code: [Nereid Demo Store on Github](https://github.com/openlabs/nereid-demo-store)\r\n\r\n## A walkthrough\r\n\r\nSo you might be wondering how do I test this store ? Well, below are some quick tasks which will get you used to the system. Remember that we rest the system every 2 hours, so none of your data will be saved when that happens!\r\n\r\nNote: The store is based on Tryton 2.4 version. So you need a version 2.4 [Tryton Client](http://www.tryton.org/downloads.html). Familiarity with Tryton is assumed in the following examples. However, if you are not familiar with Tryton, feel free to contact our team at sales@openlabs.co.in or catch one of us on the Tryton IRC (on freenode).\r\n\r\n### Tip 1: Modifying the product information\r\n\r\nIdentify a product and try changing its name, simple description and other information. You might even want to test the multi-language feature by changing the name of the product in different languages.\r\n\r\n### Tip 2: Availability of product\r\n\r\nThe product availability is computed every time and only a handful of products, mostly the ones in the homepage are available. You could test the behavior by creating a new purchase or by Inventory adjustments.\r\n\r\n### Tip 3: Complete a checkout\r\n\r\nComplete a checkout process and see the same as a new order in your confirmed sales. If you used paypal gateway you can even see your confirmed invoice since the order was prepaid.\r\n\r\n## Have more questions ?\r\n\r\nFeel free to mail us at sales@openlabs.co.in, or if you live near us - feel free to drop in for a cup of coffee (or a Beer!).
